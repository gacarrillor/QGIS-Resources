### Processing Scripts (PyQGIS) by Germ√°n Carrillo

 - **export_composers_of_multiple_projects.py**

   This script allows you to export the composers of all the QGIS projects that are inside a base folder.
   It's based on the 'Maps Printer' plugin by [Harrissou Sant-anna](https://github.com/DelazJ), which is required to run the script.

 - **edit_in_place_script.py**

   This script can be taken as an example of a script that edits a layer in-place. That is, a script that modifies features from the input layer, instead of generating a copy of the layer.     

 - **field_calculator_for_input_layer.py**
 
    This script can calculate values from QGIS expression in the input layer. That is, unlike the native 'Field Calculator' algorithm that comes within QGIS, this script does not create a new layer for its calculations.
