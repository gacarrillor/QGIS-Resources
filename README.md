### Processing Scripts (PyQGIS) by Germ√°n Carrillo

 - **Export_Composers_of_Multiple_Projects.py**

   This script allows you to export the composers of all the QGIS projects that are inside a base folder.
   It's based on the 'Maps Printer' plugin by [Harrissou Sant-anna](https://github.com/DelazJ), which is required to run the script.

 - **processing_script_edit_in_place.py**

   This script can be taken as an example of a script that edits a layer in-place. That is, a script that modifies features from the input layer, instead of generating a copy of the layer.
